## 📌 Project Description

QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup founded in 2020 that connects customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens.  

In June 2025, the company faced a major crisis triggered by a viral food safety incident at partner restaurants and a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season. The situation led to significant customer backlash, which competitors further exploited through aggressive campaigns.

This project analyzes the impact of the crisis and evaluates QuickBite Express’s recovery using data analytics, focusing on customer behavior, restaurant activity, and revenue trends.
